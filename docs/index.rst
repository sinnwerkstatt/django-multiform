Welcome to django-multiform's documentation!
============================================

Django-multiform is a library that allows you to wrap several forms
into one object with a form-like API.

It's compatible with django 1.4 and 1.5.

A lot of care has been put into replicating the same API as Form so that a
MultiForm can be used anywhere a regular Form would.

The library consists of two classes: ``MultiForm`` and ``MultiModelForm``.


MultiForm
---------

Wraps up several ``Form`` into one object, which allows you for example
to reuse several existing forms in a generic ``FormView``.

.. sourcecode:: python

    # forms.py
    from django import forms

    from multiform import MultiForm

    class FooForm(forms.Form):
        foo = forms.CharField()

    class BarForm(forms.Form):
        bar = forms.CharField()

    class FooBarForm(MultiForm):
        base_forms = {
            'foo': FooForm,
            'bar': BarForm
        }

    # views.py
    from django.views import generic
    from .forms import FooBarForm

    class FooBarView(generic.FormView):
        form_class = FooBarForm

        def form_valid(self, form):
            form.cleaned_data['foo'] # {'foo': ...}
            form.cleaned_data['bar'] # {'bar': ...}
            return super(FooBarView, self).form_valid(form)


MultiModelForm
--------------

As the name hints, it wraps several ``ModelForm`` instances into one object.

It's quite similar to ``MultiForm``, but it adds a ``save`` method and it can
handle the dispatching of the ``instance`` attribute that you usually
pass to a ``ModelForm``.

It's useful for creating related model instances in one step with a generic
CreateView for example.

.. sourcecode:: python

    # models.py
    from django.db import models

    class Person(models.Model):
        eye_color = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        user = models.OneToOneField(auth.get_user_model())

    # forms.py
    from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
    from .models import Person

    from multiform import MultiModelForm

    class PersonUserForm(MultiModelForm):
        base_forms = {
            'person': PersonForm,
            'user': UserCreationForm,
        }

        def dispatch_init_instance(self, name, instance):
            if name == 'person':
                return instance
            return super(PersonUserForm, self).dispatch_init_instance(name, instance)

        def save(self, commit=True):
            """Save both forms and attach the user to the person."""
            instances = super(PersonUserForm, self).save(commit=False)
            instances['person'].user = instances['user']
            if commit:
                for instance in instances.values():
                    instance.save()
            return instances


Dispatching Parameters
----------------------

In the event that you want to pass different parameters to some of the wrapped
forms, you have two options (that can be used independently):

1) Implement a ``dispatch_init_$arg`` method on your subclass.
   This method will be called when builting the keyword arguments passed to
   a wrapped form's constructor.
   This method is passed two arguments: the name of the wrapped form being built,
   and the original value of the $arg keyword argument.

2) Pass a ``$name__$arg=foo`` keyword argument to the MultiForm's constructor.
   This will make it so that the wrapped form with the name of ``$name`` will be
   passed the ``$arg=foo`` keyword argument.
   Note that in case of conflicts, this method has priority over the first one.


Any keyword argument passed to a Multiform's contructor that's not part of
the Form's signature and that's not of the form ``$name__*`` will be passed to
all wrapped forms.
