django-multiform
================

Django-multiform is a library that allows you to wrap several forms
into one object with a form-like API.

This allows you for example to use a generic view like CreateView to
create several different types of models at once.


.. sourcecode:: python

    # forms.py
    from django import forms

    class FooForm(forms.Form):
        foo = forms.CharField()

    class BarForm(forms.Form):
        bar = forms.CharField()

    class FooBarForm(MultiForm):
        base_forms = {
            'foo': FooForm,
            'bar': BarForm
        }

    # views.py
    from django.views import generic
    from .forms import FooBarForm

    class FooBarView(generic.FormView):
        form_class = FooBarForm

    def form_valid(self, form):
        form.cleaned_data['foo'] # {'foo': ...}
        form.cleaned_data['bar'] # {'bar': ...}
        return super(FooBarView, self).form_valid(form)


.. sourcecode:: python

    # models.py
    from django.db import models

    class Person(models.Model):
        eye_color = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        user = models.OneToOneField(auth.get_user_model())

    # forms.py
    from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
    from .models import Person

    class PersonUserForm(MultiModelForm):
        base_forms = {
            'person': PersonForm,
            'user': UserCreationForm,
        }

        def dispatch_init_instance(self, name, instance):
            if name == 'person':
                return instance
            return super(PersonUserForm, self).dispatch_init_instance(name, instance)

        def save(self, commit=True):
            """Save both forms and attach the user to the person."""
            instances = super(PersonUserForm, self).save(commit=False)
            instances['person'].user = instances['user']
            if commit:
                for instance in instances.values():
                    instance.save()
            return instances


A lot of care has been put into replicating the same API as Form so that a
MultiForm can be used anywhere a regular Form would.

In the event that you want to pass different parameters to some of the wrapped
forms, you have two options (that can be used independently):

1) Implement a ``dispatch_init_$arg`` method on your subclass.
   This method will be called when builting the keyword arguments passed to
   a wrapped form's constructor.
   This method is passed two arguments: the name of the wrapped form being built,
   and the original value of the $arg keyword argument.

2) Pass a ``$name__$arg=foo`` keyword argument to the MultiForm's constructor.
   This will make it so that the wrapped form with the name of ``$name`` will be
   passed the ``$arg=foo`` keyword argument.
   Note that in case of conflicts, this method has priority over the first one.


Any keyword argument passed to a Multiform's contructor that's not part of
the Form's signature and that's not of the form ``$name__*`` will be passed to
all wrapped forms.
